> Hey
> our past ideas arent really going that well 
> cause they are all physical 
> but i have an amazing software idea for a nice app
> so uk airdrop and stuff right its about like 5mbps
> but if you had a 540x540 pixel square that you refreshed 10 times a second with 4 possible color arrangements, then you could have 11.6mbps through the camra, and its possible to update up to like say 100 different colors, 291 mbps so just develop an app to take bits into colordata flash it, another device holds its camera over the first device, and recives data at that massive speed
> its all software 
>im brushing up on Java and Python for android development but if ur interested i want to hash out an algorithm to actually build like a lightweight app
> hmu if ur interested in this actual idea
